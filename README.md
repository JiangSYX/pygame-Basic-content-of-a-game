# pygame-Basic-content-of-a-game
The basic content of a game, including start interface, home page, menu, exit interface, level selection, scene switching, animation, shooting, collision detection, neural network pathfinding and other functions. This is just the basic content of a game. The game design is unreasonable, and the loading interface is pseudo asynchronous loading

scene:\n
    Start scene
    homepage
    Loading interface
    Exit the game interface
    Level selection interface
    Create new archive interface(It can only be opened after the game has been run)
    About interface
    Setting interface
    menu
    7 game scenes
    
There are seven game scenes in the game, but only the first one has an environment (it's not written because the game optimization is not good)
